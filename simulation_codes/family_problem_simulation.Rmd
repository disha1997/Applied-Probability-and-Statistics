A small community organization consists of 20 families of which 4 have one child, 8 have two children, 5 have 3 children, 2 have four children, and 1 has five children. If one of those families are chosen at random, what is the probability that it has 3 children?

```{r}
s1 = c(1,2,3,4,5)
p = c(0.20, 0.40, .25, .10, .05)
families = function(){
  family_picked = 0
  for (j in c(1:20)){
    family_picked = sample(s, replace = FALSE, prob = p)
  }
  return(family_picked)
}

nSimulations = 10000
simulatedData = replicate(nSimulations, families())

checkEvent = function(data){
  return(data==3)
}

mean(apply(simulatedData,2,checkEvent))*100
